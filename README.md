Reproducibility for Experiments in "FPR Estimation for Fraud Detection in the Presence of Class-Conditional Label Noise"

In this notebook we reproduce (most of) the experiments included in the paper above.

To run this notebook, you will need to install the Fraud Dataset Benchmark https://github.com/amazon-science/fraud-dataset-benchmark along with any other missing dependencies (e.g. Catboost, Cleanlab, etc.)

Then the ipython notebook can be run to reproduce the experiments included in the paper.
